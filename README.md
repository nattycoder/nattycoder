## 🏠 Home Server Enthusiast | 🌐 Self-Hosting Aficionado

Hey there! I'm passionate about building and managing home servers, self-hosting services, and optimizing network infrastructure. My playground? A home lab where I experiment with various technologies to create efficient, resource-friendly solutions.

### 🛠️ What I'm Working On

- Building and maintaining a home server for various self-hosted services
- Implementing network traffic control and monitoring solutions
- Setting up Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and alerting mechanisms
- Creating dashboards for network metrics visualization
- Deploying and managing core network services (DNS, VPN, Proxies, Firewalls)
